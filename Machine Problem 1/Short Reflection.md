# **CSST 102 Machine Problem 1: Short Reflection**



&nbsp;	The type of Machine Learning that was used in the task is supervised learning because the dataset includes defined data labels that are meant to be predicted. In this task, we trained a model through Linear Regression or Logic Regression to map features to the target using the data labels and the model will make predictions on new, unseen data. The challenge that might affect the model can be missing data because it can be less accurate unless the missing data is handled properly.
